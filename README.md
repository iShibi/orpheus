## Orpheus

Orpheus uses [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to provide personalized track recommendations based on a variety of factors, including artists, songs, genres, and track attributes like acousticness, danceability, loudness, and more.

All recommended tracks are linked directly to Spotify, so a song starts playing with a single click! Plus, each recommendations page has a unique, shareable link, making it easy to share your music discoveries with others.
